# Student-Portfolio-
The project was customized by:
Designing a unique layout and styling using HTML and CSS to reflect the student's personality and preferences.
Adding a professional profile picture and using animations and transitions to make the website more interactive.
Creating a visually appealing "Projects" section that highlights the student's work with clear descriptions and skills used.
Implementing smooth scrolling and a "Top" button for improved user experience.
Using Boxicons for social media links to add visual appeal and consistency across the site.
The project is modeled using a combination 
of front-end web development technologies:
HTML: For structuring the content of the website.
CSS: For styling and layout, including animations and transitions.
JavaScript: For interactive features such as smooth scrolling and the "Top" button functionality.
Boxicons: For consistent and visually appealing social media icons.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the website is accessible and looks good on various devices and screen sizes.
